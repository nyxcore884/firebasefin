## 🧠 SMART REASONING EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Can Handle
**User:** "Analyze revenue trends for the past 6 months"

**System:**
```
✓ Complexity: MODERATE
✓ Required: DATA_RETRIEVAL, ANALYSIS, VISUALIZATION
✓ Can handle: YES
✓ Processing time: ~20 seconds
→ Executes and provides comprehensive analysis
```

### Example 2: Needs Clarification
**User:** "Show me the numbers"

**System:**
```
⚠ Complexity: AMBIGUOUS
✓ Response: "I'd be happy to help! Could you clarify:
   1. Which numbers? (Revenue, expenses, profits, etc.)
   2. Which time period? (Last month, Q3, YTD, etc.)
   3. Which entities? (All regions, specific company, etc.)
   4. What format? (Table, chart, summary, etc.)"
```

### Example 3: Cannot Handle (Yet)
**User:** "Run Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 iterations"

**System:**
```
✗ Complexity: EXPERT
✗ Required: MONTE_CARLO_SIMULATION (not available)
✗ Can handle: NO
✓ Alternative: "I cannot perform Monte Carlo simulations yet, 
   but I can:
   - Create scenario analysis (best/worst/likely cases)
   - Perform sensitivity analysis on key assumptions
   - Generate deterministic forecasts with ranges
   Would you like me to start with scenario analysis?"
```
